# employee-summary (w.i.p.)
Trying to develop an employee summary app with the use of classes, constructors, while using Jest to test if code is viable. 

My mission:

Create an Employee constructor and import it to more specified employee roles such as Engineer, Manager, and Intern.  Using the 'inquirer' npm, I was to also 
allow users to use functions that allowed them to check an employee's name, id, and role.  

Final Product should:

Allow managers to check on the credentials of all the employees.  With this command line application, they should be able to access employee information all in one spot. For example, aside from the standard returned results such as searching an employee's name or email, someone is able to check which school an intern went to, or what username an engineer is using on GitHub. The app will also be running a Node CLI to gather information on all the employees.  But the most important part is utilizing Jest and making sure all the code is usable and passes all tests.
